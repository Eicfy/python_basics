#The first three students in the list represent the ranking of the Faculty of Engineering, while the last three students belong to the ranking of the Faculty of Medicine.

Let's use enumerate to display the student rankings within their respective faculties.

students = ["Ali", "Veli", "Ay≈üe", "Talat", "Zeynep", "Ece"]

for i, x in enumerate(students):
    if i < 3:
        i += 1
        print("Faculty of Engineering", i, ". student: ", x)
    else:
        i -=2
        print("Faculty of Medicine", i, ". student: ", x)
